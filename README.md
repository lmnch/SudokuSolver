# Background
I had nothing to do on a saturday afternoon and I was too lazy to solve the Sudoku manually.
So I created a small script to do this automatically.

# Usage
Enter sudoku cell per cell (number or '-' for empty) from left to right and split rows with ' '.

Example:
```
java -jar sudokusolver.jar -9----5-2 -8--1-9-- ---3-2--- -16-4---- --458--19 --5-3--7- --9853--4 1--92---5 4-------8
```
